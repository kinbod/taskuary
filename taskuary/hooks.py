"""Claude Code tells Taskuary what it is doing - through Claude's own hooks, in the checkout.

A live session is a pty: the Board sees a terminal, not tool calls. Claude Code's hooks fix that
without touching the agent: a PostToolUse / Stop / UserPromptSubmit entry in the checkout's
.claude/settings.local.json pipes each event's JSON to POST /api/hooks/claude, and the Board card
reads "Edit taskuary/server.py · 4s" instead of guessing from the screen. Additive and local: the
file is the project-LOCAL settings Claude itself gitignores, existing hooks are kept, and only our
entries (marked by the endpoint path) are replaced. Off with the agent_hooks setting.
